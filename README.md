AppleScript
===========

## Overview

These are some utility AppleScripts I've worked on over the years.  After initial excitement at being able to automate GUI applications, I've generally felt AppleScript to be somewhat painful to get your head into.  The lack of an included debugger didn't help either.

## The Code

Scripts:
* [Do Shell Script.applescript](Do Shell Script.applescript) - Trivial wrapper for shell scripts.  (Mac OS X)
* [Move Events to Calendar.applescript](Move Events to Calendar.applescript) - Move events from multiple calendars into a single calendar. (Mac OS X)
* [Unlock Items.applescript](Unlock Items.applescript) - Recursively unlock files. (Classic Mac OS, untested on Mac OS X)

Projects:
* [Checkbook](Checkbook) - A weekend web app written in AppleScript. I did this in college for an art history / media studies class.
